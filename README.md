### 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi, I’m Pulkit Chopra — a Full Stack Developer and Competitive Programmer with a strong interest in building scalable web applications and solving real-world problems. I’m currently pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science at Chandigarh University, where I maintain a CGPA of 8.44.

I work primarily with the MERN stack, and I’ve built projects like BloodLink, a full-stack blood shortage and donor booking system with role-based dashboards and real-time updates. I also created CGPA Booster, a simple yet effective platform to help students access study resources easily.

I’ve interned as a Software Development Intern at Anexa Home Appliances, where I collaborated with engineering and design teams, worked on both front-end and back-end tasks, explored basic ML concepts, and maintained high-quality, well-tested code.
I also contribute to open-source through the GirlScript Summer of Code, working with mentors and contributors to improve MERN-based projects.

Along with development, I’ve always been active in the coding community. I served as the Community Head of an on-campus coding group where I mentored 500+ students, hosted coding contests, and conducted more than 30 DSA problem-solving sessions.

I enjoy challenging myself — I’ve been a National Semi-Finalist in Flipkart GRID, earned an Elite + Gold NPTEL certificate in IoT, and participated in multiple hackathons and coding contests. Till now, I’ve solved 700+ DSA problems, which has strengthened my logic and analytical skills.

I’m constantly learning, building, and trying to improve a little every day — both as a developer and as a person.
